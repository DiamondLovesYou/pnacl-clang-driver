# DO NOT PUT CREDENTIALS IN HERE
# The util crate is also published in a private alternative registry,
# but since it refers to a few crates.io crates, we have to explicitly
# redirect cargo back crates.io.
# The sad thing is, `crates-io` as specified below is not built in
# to Cargo! So to not require configuring this registry manually, we have
# this file here.
